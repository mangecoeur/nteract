Note: this isn't feature complete yet. There will be :bug:s and quirks. Please come tell us about them!

### Installing

Head to the [Releases](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases) page and download the version for your OS.

<!-- TODO: Explain how to install per each platform, likely with screenshots -->

### Scope and goals

* Notebook environment to explore and get things done ✅
* Standalone cross-platform desktop application ✅
* Easy install with pre-configured Python3 and JavaScript runtimes ❌
* Grow an ecosystem of tooling to allow others to build their own platforms relying on the Jupyter specifications 🔜

### Contributing

The contributors are listed in [contributors](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/graphs/contributors)

nteract uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions, with the caveat that we use the BSD-3-Clause to be in line with the rest of the scientific packages in NumFocus.

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to rgbkrk@gmail.com.

### Design

* Full compliance with [Jupyter message spec v5](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/messaging.html)
* Full compliance with [Notebook format v4](http://nbformat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/format_description.html)
* Follow notebook model operations flow from [commutable](https://github.com/nteract/commutable)
* Rely on common interfaces for kernel communication via [enchannel's comm spec](https://github.com/nteract/enchannel) (Go read it!)
* Mocks for UI can be explored in issues, while design references go in [mocks](https://github.com/nteract/mocks)
* React for views (pushing notebook state down into the view)
* Full node, direct to zmq (no running a Python server underneath) - you still get Python kernels though!

### Development

To get started developing install a [python runtime](#python-runtime) then install [`nteract` itself](#install-nteract-itself).

#### Python runtime

At least for now, we need the python 3 kernel installed when hacking on nteract:

```
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user
```

#### Install `nteract` itself

Requires [node 6.x and npm 3](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone it `git clone https://github.com/nteract/nteract`
3. `cd` to where you `clone`d it
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

#### Troubleshooting

> I upgraded my developer installation and things are broken!

- Try `$ rm -rf node_modules` then `$ npm install`

### Frontend background

As much as possible, we'd like to get people speaking a common language for
development of nteract components and packages.

Core tech behind the scenes:

* [Observables](http://cycle.js.org/observables.html) through [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Jupyter Messaging](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/messaging.html)
* [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all)

These are our suggested tutorials and background to help you get up to speed:

* [Build your own REPL with enchannel](https://github.com/nteract/docs/blob/master/enchannel/build-your-own-repl.md)
* [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)
* [Full Stack Redux Tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)

Depending on where you plug yourself in, you may find the introduction to Reactive
programming is the biggest help.

If you'd like to experiment with the core Jupyter messaging and Observables
without working with React, check out [ick](https://github.com/nteract/ick),
an interactive console.

Post in [Slack](http://slack.nteract.in/) if you need help with these or have questions. Several people
are working through tutorials right now and would love a study group! If you have trouble creating an account, either email rgbkrk@gmail.com or post an issue on GitHub.
